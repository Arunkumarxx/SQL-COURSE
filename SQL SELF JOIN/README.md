In SQL, a self join is a join operation where a table is joined with itself. This can be useful when you have hierarchical data or when you want to compare rows within the same table. Here's the syntax for a self join:

### Syntax:

```sql
SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, ..., t2.column1, t2.column2, ...
FROM table_name t1
JOIN table_name t2 ON t1.related_column = t2.related_column;
```

- `t1` and `t2`: Aliases for the same table. They represent two different instances of the same table.
- `table_name`: The name of the table being joined.
- `related_column`: A column in the table that relates the rows being joined.

### Example:

Suppose you have a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `manager_id`. The `manager_id` column stores the `employee_id` of the manager for each employee. If you want to retrieve the names of employees along with the names of their managers, you can use a self join:

```sql
SELECT e.first_name AS employee_name, m.first_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

In this example, `e` and `m` are aliases for the `employees` table. The self join retrieves the `first_name` of each employee (`e.first_name`) along with the `first_name` of their corresponding manager (`m.first_name`) based on the `manager_id` relationship.

### Note:

- Self joins can be used to create hierarchical queries or to compare rows within the same table.
- It's important to use table aliases (`t1` and `t2` in the example) to differentiate between the two instances of the same table in the query.
