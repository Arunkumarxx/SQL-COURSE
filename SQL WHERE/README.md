The `WHERE` clause in SQL is used to filter rows returned by a SELECT statement. It allows you to specify conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the result set.the syntax for the `WHERE` clause:

### Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `column1, column2, ...`: The columns you want to retrieve from the table.
- `table_name`: The name of the table from which you want to retrieve data.
- `condition`: The condition that each row must meet to be included in the result set.

### Example:

Suppose you have a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department_id`, and you want to retrieve employees from the 'Sales' department:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 1;
```

This query will retrieve the `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` columns from the `employees` table where the `department_id` is equal to 1 (assuming 'Sales' department has department_id = 1).

### Note:

- The `WHERE` clause can contain multiple conditions combined using logical operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
- You can use comparison operators (e.g., `=`, `>`, `<`, `<>`) and other functions in the condition to specify more complex filtering criteria.
- The `WHERE` clause is optional. If omitted, all rows from the table will be returned.
