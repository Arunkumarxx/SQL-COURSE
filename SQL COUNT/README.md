**SQL COUNT Syntax:**

In SQL, the COUNT function is used to return the number of rows that match a specified condition. Here's the syntax for using the COUNT function:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

- **column_name**: The column or expression for which you want to count the rows. If you want to count all rows, you can use * or specify a column name.
- **table_name**: The name of the table from which you want to count the rows.
- **condition**: (Optional) Specifies the condition for which rows to count. If omitted, all rows in the table are counted.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Count all rows in the "employees" table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

-- Count the number of distinct values in the "department_id" column of the "employees" table
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department_id) FROM employees;

-- Count the number of rows in the "orders" table where the
 "status" column is 'completed'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed';
```

The COUNT function can be combined with other SQL 
functions and clauses to perform more complex 
counting operations, such as counting distinct values
or counting rows based on specific conditions.
