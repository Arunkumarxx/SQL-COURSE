It seems you're asking about combining a `SELECT` statement with an `INSERT INTO` statement in SQL. This can be done to insert data into a table based on the result of a query.

### `Syntax`:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM source_table
WHERE condition;
```

- `table_name`: The name of the table into which you want to insert the new records.
- `column1, column2, column3, ...`: The columns into which you want to insert values.
- `source_table`: The table from which you want to select data.
- `condition`: Optional. Specifies the condition to filter the rows to be inserted.

### `Example`:

Let's say we have a table named `employees` and we want to insert records into another table named `new_employees` based on certain criteria.

```sql
INSERT INTO new_employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary)
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

This statement inserts records into the `new_employees` table, selecting data from the `employees` table where the `department` is 'IT'.

### `Note`:

- The columns selected in the `SELECT` statement must match the columns specified in the `INSERT INTO` statement.
- The result set returned by the `SELECT` statement determines the data inserted into the target table.
- You can use any valid `SELECT` statement, including joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions, to retrieve the data to be inserted.
- Make sure the target table has the same structure (same number and type of columns) as the result set returned by the `SELECT` statement.
