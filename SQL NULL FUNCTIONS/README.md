The `IFNULL()` function in SQL is used to replace NULL values with a specified alternative value. It is primarily used in MySQL, but similar functionality exists in other database systems with functions like `COALESCE()`.

### `IFNULL() Function Syntax` (MySQL):

```sql
IFNULL(expr1, expr2)
```

- `expr1`: The expression that you want to check for NULL.
- `expr2`: The value to return if `expr1` is NULL.

### `Example`:

Consider a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id` and `salary`. To handle NULL values in the `salary` column and replace them with a default value of 0, you can use the `IFNULL()` function:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, IFNULL(salary, 0) AS salary
FROM employees;
```

This query returns the `employee_id` and the `salary`, replacing NULL salaries with 0.

### `Note`:

- The `IFNULL()` function is specific to MySQL. Other database systems might have similar functions like `COALESCE()` to achieve the same functionality.
- It's essential to provide a default value that matches the data type of the column you are replacing NULL values with to avoid data type conversion errors.
- Always refer to the documentation of the specific database system you are using for precise syntax and function availability.
