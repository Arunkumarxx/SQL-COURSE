The `SELECT` statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to specify which columns you want to retrieve and apply filtering conditions to limit the rows returned by the query. Here's the syntax for the `SELECT` statement:

### Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `column1, column2, ...`: The columns you want to retrieve from the table. You can specify multiple columns separated by commas, or you can use `*` to select all columns.
- `table_name`: The name of the table from which you want to retrieve data.
- `condition`: (Optional) Specifies a condition to filter the rows selected from the table. This is typically done using the `WHERE` clause.

### Example:

Suppose you have a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department_id`. If you want to retrieve the `employee_id` and `first_name` columns for all employees who belong to the `Sales` department (assuming the `department_id` for the Sales department is 1):

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 1;
```

This query will retrieve the `employee_id` and `first_name` columns from the `employees` table where the `department_id` is equal to 1 (Sales department).

### Note:

- You can use various clauses with the `SELECT` statement, such as `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, etc., to further manipulate the result set.
- SQL is a versatile language, and the `SELECT` statement can be customized in many ways to suit different requirements.
