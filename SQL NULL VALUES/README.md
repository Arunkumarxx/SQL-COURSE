In SQL, NULL represents the absence of a value or an unknown value in a column. It's essential to handle NULL values correctly in queries to ensure accurate results.

### `Syntax for Handling NULL Values`:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```

- `columns`: The columns you want to retrieve from the result set.
- `table_name`: The table from which you want to retrieve data.
- `column_name`: The column you want to check for NULL values.

### `Example`:

Consider a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. If you want to retrieve employees whose `last_name` is NULL, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name IS NULL;
```

This query retrieves the `employee_id` and `first_name` of employees whose `last_name` is NULL.

### `Note`:

- Always use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators to check for NULL values, as the equality operator (`=`) does not work for NULL comparisons.
- NULL values can affect the results of aggregate functions and mathematical operations, so handle them appropriately in your queries.
- Understanding how NULL values are handled in your database system is crucial for writing accurate queries and ensuring data integrity.
