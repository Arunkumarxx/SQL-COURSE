In SQL, the `NOT` operator is used to negate a condition in a WHERE clause. It is often used in combination with other operators to filter rows that do not meet a certain condition.

### `Syntax`:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE NOT condition;
```

- `columns`: The columns you want to retrieve from the result set.
- `table`: The table from which you want to retrieve data.
- `condition`: The condition that rows must not meet to be included in the result set.

### `Example`:

Consider a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. If you want to retrieve employees whose first name is not 'John', you can use the `NOT` operator as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT first_name = 'John';
```

This query selects all columns from the `employees` table where the `first_name` is not equal to 'John'.

### `Note`:

- The `NOT` operator can be used with various comparison operators such as `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, etc., to negate the condition specified.
- It can also be used to negate the result of logical expressions such as `AND`, `OR`, etc., to reverse the logic of the condition.
