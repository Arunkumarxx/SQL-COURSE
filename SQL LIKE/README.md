The SQL LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern within a column. It can be used in conjunction with the SELECT statement to retrieve records based on partial matches or patterns.

### `Syntax`:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
```

- `columns`: The columns you want to retrieve from the result set.
- `table`: The table from which you want to retrieve data.
- `column_name`: The column in which you want to search for the pattern.
- `LIKE`: The operator used for pattern matching.
- `pattern`: The pattern to search for. It can include wildcard characters like % (matches any string of zero or more characters) and _ (matches any single character).

### `Example`:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM products 
WHERE product_name LIKE 'App%';
```

This query retrieves all records from the `products` table where the `product_name` starts with 'App'.

### `Note`:

- The LIKE operator is case-insensitive by default in most database systems, but this behavior may vary depending on the database configuration.
- You can use the % wildcard at the beginning, end, or both beginning and end of the pattern to perform wildcard searches.
- The _ wildcard matches any single character.
- You can combine the LIKE operator with other SQL operators (e.g., AND, OR) to create more complex search conditions.
