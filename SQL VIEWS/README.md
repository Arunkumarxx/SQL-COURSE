In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result set of a SELECT statement. It provides a way to encapsulate complex queries and present them as a simple table to the users.  an overview of SQL views:

### Syntax to Create a View:

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `view_name`: The name of the view being created.
- `column1, column2, ...`: The columns to include in the view.
- `table_name`: The name of the table(s) from which data is retrieved.
- `condition`: (Optional) Specifies conditions to filter the rows included in the view.

### Example:

Suppose you have a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department_id`. If you want to create a view that includes only the employees from the 'Sales' department:

```sql
CREATE VIEW sales_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 1;
```

Now, `sales_employees` is a view that contains only the employees from the 'Sales' department.

### Using Views:

Once created, you can treat a view like a regular table:

- Query data from the view using the `SELECT` statement.
- Update data in the underlying tables using the view (if the view is updatable).
- Drop the view using the `DROP VIEW` statement when it's no longer needed.

### Benefits of Views:

- Simplify complex queries: Views hide the complexity of underlying queries by presenting a simplified interface to users.
- Data security: Views can restrict access to certain columns or rows, providing a level of security.
- Code reusability: Views can be reused in multiple queries, reducing the need to rewrite complex logic.

### Note:

- Views do not store data themselves; they only store the definition of the SELECT statement used to create them.
- Changes to the underlying tables are reflected in the view results, and vice versa.
- Views can improve performance by precomputing complex queries and storing the results temporarily.
