**SQL Comments Syntax:**

In SQL, comments can be used to document and annotate the code for better understanding 
and maintenance. There are two common ways to write comments in SQL:

1. Single Line Comment:
   ```
   -- This is a single line comment in SQL
   ```

2. Multi-Line Comment:
   ```
   /* 
      This is a multi-line comment in SQL
      It can span multiple lines
   */
   ```

# SQL Comments Syntax

In SQL, comments can be used to annotate the code for better understanding. Here's a
 quick guide on how to use comments in SQL:

## Single Line Comment
Single line comments start with -- and extend to the end of the line. For example:
```
-- This is a single line comment in SQL
```

## Multi-Line Comment
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. They can span multiple lines. For example:
```
/* 
   This is a multi-line comment in SQL
   It can span multiple lines
*/
