# SQL ANY and ALL Operators

The `ANY` and `ALL` operators in SQL allow you to
perform comparisons between a single column value
and a range of other values.

## SQL ANY Operator

The `ANY` operator returns a boolean value as result.
 It returns `TRUE` if ANY of the subquery values meet
 the condition.

### Syntax

sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition);
```

### Example 1: Using ANY Operator

```sql
-- Selecting ProductName if ANY records in OrderDetails table have Quantity equal to 10
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);
```

| ProductName                      |

| ...                              |

### Example 2: Using ANY Operator (with empty result)

```sql
-- Selecting ProductName if ProductID equals ALL CustomerIDs from Customers table (empty result)
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ALL (SELECT CustomerID FROM Customers);
```

(No results returned)
