In SQL, the `OR` operator is used in the `WHERE` clause to retrieve rows that meet at least one of several conditions specified in the query.

### `OR Operator Syntax`:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
```

- `columns`: The columns you want to retrieve from the result set.
- `table`: The table from which you want to retrieve data.
- `condition1`, `condition2`: Conditions that you want to test. If any of these conditions are true, the row is included in the result set.

### `Example`:

Consider a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. If you want to retrieve employees whose first name is either 'John' or last name is 'Doe', you can use the `OR` operator as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'John' OR last_name = 'Doe';
```

This query selects all columns from the `employees` table where the first name is 'John' or the last name is 'Doe'.

### `Note`:

- The `OR` operator allows you to combine multiple conditions in a `WHERE` clause to create more complex filtering criteria.
- If either of the conditions separated by `OR` is true, the row is included in the result set.
- Be cautious when using `OR` in queries as it can lead to unintended results if not used carefully.
